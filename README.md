# testing
where to dump anything that might be useful

dan_playingaround:

    top part is me looking at all available envs on openai gym, 
    and setting up a little interactive cell to render an environment of my choosing

    towards the bottom I started to sketch a little nerual network in tensorflow connecting
    state spaces (and action spaces) between two different environments. Also many important
    TODOs sketching out some of the requirements of the implementation and considerations underlying
    those requirements.
